# AI Coding Usage Card

A self-hosted GitHub profile card that shows how many tokens (and how much API-equivalent money) you've burned across your AI coding tools — **Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, Copilot CLI, OpenCode, and everything else [ccusage](https://github.com/ccusage/ccusage) detects**.

No external services. No accounts. No API keys. Everything runs on your machine against your own local logs, and the card is just an SVG committed to your profile repo.

**Live examples** — all four variants, auto-updating daily from my own usage:

`ai-usage-full.svg` (846×225)

## Variants

One run generates all four — embed whichever you like:

| File | Size | Content |
|---|---|---|
| `ai-usage-full.svg` | 846×225 | Everything: totals, 4-currency cost, token mix, activity, per-tool split |
| `ai-usage-half.svg` | 423×195 | ALL-TIME + COST only — two halves side by side = one full width |
| `ai-usage-grass.svg` | 423×195 | 26-week usage grass only — pairs with the half card (GitHub 잔디 for AI usage) |
| `ai-usage-half-grass.svg` | 423×335 | Half card + 26-week usage grass stacked |
| `ai-usage-combo.svg` | 846×195 | Half + grass merged side by side in a single SVG |

## What it shows

| Block | Content |
|---|---|
| ALL-TIME | Total tokens + cache-hit ratio |
| COST | API-equivalent cost in USD + 3 currencies of your choice (live FX rates, free API) |
| TOKEN MIX | Output / input / cache read / cache write |
| ACTIVITY | Active days, avg per day, peak day, top model |
| BY TOOL | Per-tool cost split (Claude Code / Codex / Gemini / Copilot) |
| GRASS | Contribution-graph-style heatmap of daily cost |

> "API-equivalent" because subscription users (Claude Max etc.) don't actually pay per token — the number is what the same usage would cost on the API. That's the fun part.

## How it works

```
ccusage (each device) ──► cards/devices/<device>.json ──► merged SVG ──► profile README
        ▲                         ▲                                  ▲
   local CLI logs           high-water merged              all devices combined
```

A scheduler (Task Scheduler / cron / launchd) runs the script once a day. Each run recomputes everything from your local logs, fetches fresh FX rates, merges the result into that device's ledger, and commits the regenerated SVG.

## Setup

**Requirements:** Node 18+, [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) logged in (`gh auth login`, `repo` scope is enough), and a profile repo (the public repo named after your username).

1. **Fork this repository, then clone your fork**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOURNAME/ai-coding-usage-card.git
   cd ai-coding-usage-card
   ```

2. **Choose a permanent device ID.** Use a different ID on every computer and never rename it later.

3. **Test run**

   ```bash
   USAGE_CARD_REPO=YOURNAME/YOURNAME USAGE_CARD_DEVICE=macbook-work node usage-card.mjs
   # [2026-07-16T...] 1 device(s), 5 cards updated @ ab12cd3: 12.6B tokens | $13,190 | Claude Code $13,190 | Codex $0.04
   ```

   Add `--dry-run` to skip the GitHub commit and write the 5 SVGs plus the merged snapshot JSON to `./out/` instead — handy for checking numbers before they go live.

4. **Embed in your profile README** (any of the four variants)

   ```html
   <img width="100%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YOURNAME/YOURNAME/main/cards/ai-usage-full.svg" alt="AI usage" />
   <img width="100%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YOURNAME/YOURNAME/main/cards/ai-usage-grass.svg" alt="AI usage grass" />
   ```

5. **Schedule it daily**

   **Windows** — no-flash wrapper + Task Scheduler:

   ```vbs
   ' usage-card.vbs
   CreateObject("Wscript.Shell").Run "cmd /c ""node ""C:\path\to\usage-card.mjs"" >> ""C:\path\to\usage-card.log"" 2>&1""", 0, False
   ```

   ```powershell
   schtasks /Create /TN "AIUsageCard" /TR 'wscript.exe "C:\path\to\usage-card.vbs"' /SC DAILY /ST 09:37 /F
   ```

   **macOS / Linux** — cron:

   ```cron
   37 9 * * * USAGE_CARD_REPO=YOURNAME/YOURNAME USAGE_CARD_DEVICE=macbook-work /usr/local/bin/node /path/to/usage-card.mjs >> /path/to/usage-card.log 2>&1
   ```

## GitHub account selection

The publisher selects the stored GitHub account named by `USAGE_CARD_GITHUB_USER`
(defaults to the repository owner). Both card and usage-note updates use that
account, regardless of the active `gh` account or inherited `GH_TOKEN` /
`GITHUB_TOKEN`. For an organization repository, set this variable to a personal
account with write access. It must already be logged in via `gh auth login`.
The job checks repository write access before collecting usage and fails with
the selected account name if access is missing. It does not switch the global
GitHub account.

Run regression checks with `node --test github-client.test.mjs usage-insights.test.mjs`.

## Daily usage note and curation insights

`run-daily.sh` publishes the cards, then runs `update-note.mjs`. The note keeps
the usage summary and adds 2–3 short cost insights with inline links to at least two
published DataNexus curations. Each run reads the live Hugo search index, selects
up to six recent cost/token/cache articles by title and summary, and supplies
their full text to the writer. New published articles enter the selection
automatically; local drafts and unpublished changes are never used.

The writer uses the installed, authenticated Claude CLI in non-interactive
safe mode with no tools or session persistence. It first produces insights
with verifiable source excerpts, then performs a separate editing pass using
the installed `junho-humanizer/SKILL.md` and citation rules. The skill's Python
linters check the result: numbers, dates, URLs and code must be preserved, and
no mandatory `FIX` findings may remain. A separate claim review checks the draft
and edited insights against the usage summary and cited articles; unsupported
claims or an incomplete review block publication. Source text is treated as data, not
instructions. Insights distinguish observations from proposed checks and must
not equate API-equivalent cost or cache-read token share with actual bills,
savings, productivity, or request-level cache hit rate.

Each insight starts with a short conclusion followed by one or two plain-language
sentences. Independent points default to a numbered list; simple collections
can use bullets, and connected explanations can use paragraphs. The draft JSON
records this choice as `format: numbered | bullets | paragraphs`. The renderer
adds list markers and blank lines between items. Both writing passes explain
technical terms on first use and avoid repeating the usage summary or billing
caveats. The existing usage-summary generator remains unchanged, and the editing
pass leaves its text intact.

Validation accepts all three formats, checks source excerpts and per-item links,
and preserves actual numbers, dollar amounts and percentages. List markers such
as `1.` and `2.` are excluded from numeric checks only after their structure is
validated; changing a real value or moving it to another item still fails.

Requirements: an authenticated `claude`, Python 3, and the `junho-humanizer`
skill. Settings:

- `USAGE_CARD_CURATION_INDEX`: defaults to `https://datanexus-kr.github.io/index.json`.
- `USAGE_CARD_HUMANIZER_DIR`: defaults to `~/.codex/skills/junho-humanizer`.
- `CLAUDE_PATH`: defaults to `~/.local/bin/claude`.
- `PYTHON_PATH`: defaults to `python3`.

Preview with `USAGE_CARD_REPO=datanexus-kr/datanexus-kr node update-note.mjs --dry-run`.
The generated draft, edited Markdown, source excerpts and validation results
are saved under ignored `out/usage-note-*` files. Identical inputs reuse a
validated cached result; changed usage, published articles, implementation or skill rules
trigger fresh generation. The writer gets at most one repair attempt per stage.
If fetching, generation, or validation fails, the previous README stays in
place and the job exits with an error; card publication is independent.
The README update replaces only the marked usage-note section.

The installed macOS LaunchAgent runs `run-daily.sh` daily at 09:40 local time.
Its log is `~/Library/Logs/ai-usage-card/run.log`.

## Multiple computers

Repeat the clone, test, and scheduling steps on each computer with a unique `USAGE_CARD_DEVICE`, such as `macbook-work`, `macbook-home`, or `desktop-windows`. Each run merges into that device's own snapshot (never another device's), then rebuilds the cards from every device snapshot, so scheduled reruns do not duplicate usage.

Use a different schedule minute on each computer (for example 09:37, 09:42, 09:47) so two devices do not update the same Git branch simultaneously.

Do not sync or copy Claude Code, Codex, or other AI CLI log directories between computers. `ccusage` exposes daily totals rather than cross-device session IDs, so copied logs cannot be deduplicated reliably.

## Retention-proof ledger

Claude Code (and other CLIs) periodically prune old session logs, so a naive re-run of `ccusage` can report *fewer* tokens than yesterday — and a card that just overwrites its snapshot every run would report a shrinking ALL-TIME total.

Each device's snapshot is instead a **daily high-water ledger**: every run merges today's `ccusage` read into the stored snapshot date by date, keeping the max of old and new for each day. Dates that already fell out of your local logs stay in the ledger forever; today's fresh numbers just get added on top. The ALL-TIME total is the sum of that merged daily history, so it only ever grows.

Snapshots written by older versions of this script (`version: 1`, no daily breakdown) are upgraded automatically the first time you run the new script — no manual migration step needed.

If you've already lost usage to log pruning *before* switching to the ledger version, you can seed a one-time `baseline` correction by committing it directly into `cards/devices/<device>.json`:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "device": "desktop-main",
  "totals": { "totalTokens": 0, "inputTokens": 0, "outputTokens": 0, "cacheCreationTokens": 0, "cacheReadTokens": 0, "totalCost": 0 },
  "daily": [],
  "toolDaily": {},
  "toolLegacy": {},
  "baseline": { "totalTokens": 300000000, "totalCost": 389, "note": "pre-ledger retention loss" }
}
```

`baseline` is only ever added to the ALL-TIME total, the COST block, and the commit message — TOKEN MIX, cache-hit %, ACTIVITY, and the grass heatmap all stay derived from the real daily history, since a baseline has no per-day or per-model breakdown to draw them from. The script never writes `baseline` itself; once seeded, it's carried forward untouched on every merge.

## Customization

- **Accent color** — `CONFIG.accent` (default: green on black; swap in your own hex)
- **Currencies** — any codes supported by [open.er-api.com](https://open.er-api.com) (`KRW`, `EUR`, `CNY`, `JPY`, `GBP`, …)
- **Layout** — it's ~80 lines of template SVG; move columns, add rows, go wild

## Gotchas (learned the hard way)

- **Escape `<` in any dynamic SVG text** (`&lt;`) — one raw `<` kills the whole card with `StartTag: invalid element name`.
- **Seeing a stale card right after a design change?** GitHub caches images aggressively. Append `?v=2` to the `<img>` URL to bust it. Daily data updates don't need this — the cache is only ~5 minutes.
- The script needs no `workflow` scope — it commits a plain file via the contents API, no Actions involved.

## 한국어 요약

로컬에 쌓인 AI 코딩 CLI 로그(ccusage가 감지하는 모든 툴)를 매일 집계해서, 누적 토큰·4개 통화 비용·툴별 분해·30일 차트를 담은 SVG 카드를 프로필 레포에 커밋하는 스크립트입니다. 외부 서비스·계정·API 키 전부 불필요.

1. 이 저장소를 fork한 뒤 `git clone https://github.com/YOURNAME/ai-coding-usage-card.git` 로 자신의 fork를 복제
2. 컴퓨터마다 겹치지 않는 고정 ID를 정하고 `USAGE_CARD_REPO=YOURNAME/YOURNAME USAGE_CARD_DEVICE=macbook-work node usage-card.mjs` 로 테스트
3. 프로필 README에 `<img width="100%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/아이디/아이디/main/cards/ai-usage-full.svg" />` 삽입 (4종 중 원하는 파일명으로)
4. 같은 `USAGE_CARD_REPO`, `USAGE_CARD_DEVICE` 환경변수를 포함해 작업 스케줄러, launchd 또는 cron으로 매일 실행 등록

각 컴퓨터는 자신의 스냅샷에 일자별 고수위(high-water) 병합만 적용하므로 재실행으로 사용량이 중복되지 않고, 로그가 정리돼도 누적치가 줄어들지 않습니다. 카드는 모든 컴퓨터의 최신 스냅샷을 합산합니다. AI CLI 로그 폴더 자체를 컴퓨터 사이에 복사하거나 동기화하면 동일 세션을 판별할 수 없으므로 지원하지 않습니다.

전제 조건은 Node 18+, `gh auth login` 완료된 GitHub CLI뿐입니다.
